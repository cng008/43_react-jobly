# React Jobly

A dynamic full stack web application which will be used to explore and "apply" for jobs online (no, these won't be REAL jobs). Functionality is similar to LinkedIn, but on a smaller scale, with a well-designed component hierarchy, a functional database, queryable API, routing, a jobs page, authentication and authorization, a user profile, in-progress applications, and more!

### Component Hierarchy

## Requirements

- Users can log in, sign up, log out, and delete their account
- View detail on a company and all the jobs available there.
- Allow users to search companies & jobs.
- Homepage shows different messages if the user is logged in or out.
- Use localStorage to keep the token in simple state. This way, when the page is loaded, it can first look for it there.
- Need to be logged in if you want to access the companies page, the jobs page, or a company details page.
- Logged-in user can edit their profile and changes are reflected elsewhere in the app.
- A user can apply for jobs. On the job info (both on the jobs page, as well as the company detail page), users can click a button to apply for a job. This changes if this is a job the user has already applied to.
